This repository contains three Python scripts (\`code1.py\`, \`code2.py\`, and \`optimizefinal.py\`) designed to find prime numbers derived from substrings of a binary string. Each script takes a binary string and a limit as input, generates all possible substrings of the binary string, converts them to decimal numbers, and identifies prime numbers below the specified limit. The scripts also measure and report the execution time.

## Overview

The three scripts perform the same task with varying implementations and optimizations:

- **code1.py**: The initial implementation using set comprehension for substring generation and a basic primality test.
- **code2.py**: An alternative implementation using a list-based approach for substring generation and a different primality test.
- **optimizefinal.py**: An optimized version with improved primality testing and substring handling for better performance.

All scripts produce similar output, listing the number of primes found and their values, with slight differences in formatting and efficiency.

## Features

- **Input**: Accepts a binary string (e.g., \"101011\") and an integer limit (e.g., \"99\") in the format \`binary,limit\`.
- **Output**: Displays the decimal value of the input binary string, the number of primes found, and a list of primes (or a summary if there are more than six primes). Also reports the runtime in seconds.
- **Error Handling**: Validates input for correct binary format and integer limit.
- **Performance**: Each script includes timing functionality to measure execution speed.

## Performance Comparison

The scripts were tested with various input sizes, and their runtimes (in seconds) are listed below for reference:

**Observations**:
- \`optimizefinal.py\` generally performs better, especially for larger inputs (cases 6–10), due to its optimized primality test and substring handling.
- \`code1.py\` is faster than \`code2.py\` in most cases, likely due to the use of set comprehension for substring generation.
- \`code2.py\` is the slowest for larger inputs, possibly due to its list-based substring generation and less efficient primality test.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- The \`math\` module is required for \`optimizefinal.py\` (standard library).
- The \`time\` module is used in all scripts for performance measurement (standard library).

## Usage

1. Run any of the scripts using Python:
   \`\`\`bash
   python code1.py
   python code2.py
   python optimizefinal.py
   \`\`\`
2. Enter the input in the format \`binary,limit\` (e.g., \`101011,99\`).
3. The script will output:
   - The decimal value of the binary string.
   - The number of primes found and their values (or a summary for more than six primes).
   - The runtime in seconds.

## Input Format

- **Binary String**: A string containing only \`0\` and \`1\` characters.
- **Limit**: A positive integer that sets the upper bound for prime numbers.
- **Format**: \`binary,limit\` (e.g., \`101011,99\`).

## Example

\`\`\`bash
Enter binary string and limit: 101011,99
Decimal value: 43
Found 3 prime(s): 5, 11, 43
Finished in 0.0004 seconds.
\`\`\`

## Notes

- **Input Validation**: All scripts check for valid binary strings and integer limits, providing appropriate error messages.
- **Performance**: For large binary strings (e.g., cases 8–10), \`optimizefinal.py\` is recommended due to its faster execution.
- **Output Format**: If more than six primes are found, the output shows the first three and last three primes for brevity.
