# Stock Price Prediction using SVR (Python)

A Python project that predicts stock prices using **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**. This project demonstrates practical skills in **data preprocessing, machine learning, and visualization** using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

## Features

- **Stock Price Simulation**
  - Generates synthetic stock price data for demonstration purposes.

- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
  - Trains an SVR model with a linear kernel to predict future stock prices.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**
  - Scales input features using `MinMaxScaler` for better model performance.

- **Performance Evaluation**
  - Calculates Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both training and testing datasets.

- **Prediction**
  - Predicts stock prices for future days.

- **Visualization**
  - Plots training data, testing data, model predictions, and future predictions using Matplotlib.
